## EAT DA BURGER

# This full stack application logs burgers with an id, name, and devoured values, then allows the user to "eat" the burger and move it to another section of the screen. This uses the MySQl, Node, Express, Handlebars APIs with a homemade ORM. The application is also deployed on Heroku.
